<h3>Syntax</h3>

<code>@lends &lt;namepath></code>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
	The <code>@lends</code> tag allows you to document all the members of an anonymous object literal as if they 
	were members of an object with the given name. You might want to do this if you were passing an anonymous 
	object literal into a function that creates a named class from its members
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
	In this example we want to use a helper function to make a class named "Person," along with instance 
	methods named "initialize" and "say." This is similar to how some popular frameworks handle class creation.
</p>

{{#example}} Example class
// we want to document this as being a class
var Person = makeClass(
    // we want to document these as being methods
    {
        initialize: function(name) {
            this.name = name;
        },
        say: function(message) {
            return this.name + " says: " + message;
        }
    }
);
{{/example}}

<p>
	Without any doc comments JsDoc Toolkit won't automatically recognize either a class named "Person" nor it's 
	two methods. To document the methods we must use a "@lends" tag in a doc comment immediately before the 
	object literal to tell JsDoc Toolkit that all the member names of that object literal are being "lent" to a 
	variable named "Person."
</p>

{{#example}} Documented as static methods
/** @class */
var Person = makeClass(
    /** @lends Person */
    {
        initialize: function(name) {
            this.name = name;
        },
        say: function(message) {
            return this.name + " says: " + message;
        }
    }
);
{{/example}}

<p>
	Now the functions named "initialize" and "say" will be documented, but they appear as static methods of an 
	class named "Person." That is possibly what you meant, but in this case we want "initialize" and "say" to 
	belong to the instances of the "Person" class. So we change things slightly by lending the methods to the 
	class's prototype:
</p>

{{#example}} Documented as instance methods
/** @class */
var Person = makeClass(
    /** @lends Person.prototype */
    {
        initialize: function(name) {
            this.name = name;
        },
        say: function(message) {
            return this.name + " says: " + message;
        }
    }
);
{{/example}}

<p>
	If you are using one of the lent functions to construct the class, you can mark it as such using the 
	@constructs tag, but remember to remove the @class tag in that case, or else two @classes will be documented.
</p>

{{#example}} Documented constructor
var Person = makeClass(
    /**
      @lends Person.prototype
    */
    {
        /** @constructs */
        initialize: function(name) {
            this.name = name;
        },
        say: function(message) {
            return this.name + " says: " + message;
        }
    }
);
{{/example}}
