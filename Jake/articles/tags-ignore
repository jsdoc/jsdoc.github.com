<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
    The @ignore tag indicates that an object in your code should be exclude from the documentation,
    when it otherwise would be documented.
</p>
<p>
    This tag has precedence over any other mechanism, and guarantees that an ignored object will not be documented.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
    Note that in the following example, both Foo and bar will be excluded from the documentation;
    when a parent object is ignored, all of its members are also ignored
</p>
